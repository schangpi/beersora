	<h3> Why "Beer"? </h3> 
	<p>I was born and raised in Thailand. Because Thai names are often long, every Thai person has a nickname associated with them since they were born. 
	Our nicknames could be anything from Apple, Nut, Boss, Coke, Pancake, Airbus, Boat, Arm, Atom, to Disney, Jumbo, and Smart. 
	My nickname, "Beer," is a very common nickname in Thailand. It means what it's supposed to mean: a well-known alcoholic beverage.</p>

	<h3> My <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkClRaaKHY0"> final project </a> for Contemporary Architecture class</h3>
	<p>I made a 3D model of Frank Gehry's "The Architect's house."</p>

	<h3> Sports </h3>
	<p>I enjoy playing <a href="http://brownrec.com/im/spring_2010_champions/champions">tennis</a>, badminton, and soccer.</p>
